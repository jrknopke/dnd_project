# DndProject

This is my Phase 1 project for Flatiron Online Software Engineering Program. It allows the user to search for Spells from Dungeons and Dragons 5e. The user can search for spells by name, level, or school of magic. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dnd_project'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dnd_project

## Usage

To run program type 'ruby bin/run'
Search for spell by spell name, level, or school of magic.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
